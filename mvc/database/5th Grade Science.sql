Description: '5th Grade Science' guides students in understanding the role of decomposers, consumers, and producers in a healthy ecosystem. They study the geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere and learn how these systems interact. They develop models to examine patterns caused by the relative positions of Earth and the sun, and identify matter as particles of  matter too small to be seen.

Description: '1st Grade Math'


Unit 1: Operations and Algebraic Thinking
1. Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.
2. Solve word problems that call for addition of three whole numbers whose sum is less than or equal to 20, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem
3. Organize, represent, and interpret data with up to three categories; ask and answer questions about the total number of data points, how many in each category, and how many more or less are in one category than in another.
4. Apply properties of operations as strategies to add and subtract.2 Examples: If 8 + 3 = 11 is known, then 3 + 8 = 11 is also known. (Commutative property of addition.) To add 2 + 6 + 4, the second two numbers can be added to make a ten, so 2 + 6 + 4 = 2 + 10 = 12. (Associative property of addition.)
5. Understand subtraction as an unknown-addend problem. For example, subtract 10 – 8 by finding the number that makes 10 when added to 8. Add and subtract within 20.
6. Determine the unknown whole number in an addition or subtraction equation relating three whole numbers. For example, determine the unknown number that makes the equation true in each of the equations 8 + ? = 11, 5 = _ – 3, 6 + 6 = _.
7. Relate counting to addition and subtraction (e.g., by counting on 2 to add 2).
8. Add and subtract within 20, demonstrating fluency for addition and subtraction within 10. Use strategies such as counting on; making ten (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14); decomposing a number leading to a ten (e.g., 13 – 4 = 13 – 3 – 1 = 10 – 1 = 9); using the relationship between addition and subtraction (e.g., knowing that 8 + 4 = 12, one knows 12 – 8 = 4); and creating equivalent but easier or known sums (e.g., adding 6 + 7 by creating the known equivalent 6 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13).
9. Understand the meaning of the equal sign, and determine if equations involving addition and subtraction are true or false. For example, which of the following equations are true and which are false? 6 = 6, 7 = 8 –1, 5 + 2 = 2 + 5, 4 + 1 = 5 + 2.

Unit 2: Numbers and Operations in Base 10 Place Value

1. Count to 120, starting at any number less than 120. In this range, read and write numerals and represent a number of objects with a written numeral.
2. Understand that the two digits of a two-digit number represent amounts of tens and ones. Understand the following as special cases:
3. 10 can be thought of as a bundle of ten ones – called a "ten".
4. The numbers from 11 to 19 are composed of a ten and one, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, or nine ones.
5. The numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 refer to one, two , three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine tens (and 0 ones)
6. Compare two two-digit numbers based on meanings of tens and ones digits, recording the results of comparisons with the symbols >, =, <.
7. Given a two-digit number, mentally find 10 more or 10 less than the number, without having to count; explain the reasoning used.
8. Add and subtract within 20, demonstrating fluency for addition and subtraction within 10. Use strategies such as counting on; making ten (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14); decomposing a number leading to a ten (e.g., 13 – 4 = 13 – 3 – 1 = 10 – 1 = 9); using the relationship between addition and subtraction (e.g., knowing that 8 + 4 = 12, one knows 12 – 8 = 4); and creating equivalent but easier or known sums (e.g., adding 6 + 7 by creating the known equivalent 6 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13).

9. Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem. (continued from Unit 1)

5. Add within 100, including adding a two-digit number and a one-digit number, and adding a two-digit number and a multiple of 10, using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and or the relationship between addition an subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method and explain the reasoning used.  Understand that in adding two-digit numbers, one adds tens and tens, ones and ones; and sometimes it is necessary to compose a ten. 
6. Subtract multiples of 10 in the range 10-90 from multiples of 10 in the range 10-90 (positive or zero differences), using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method and explain the reasoning used.

Unit 4: Elementary Geometry
1. Identify, name and compare plane geometric figures (triangles, circles, squares, rectangles and rhombi) by sorting and describing their attributes (by shape, number of sides, size or number of angles)
2. Use concrete materials to build shapes (rectangles, squares, trapezoids, triangles, half-circles and quarter-circles) that have the defining attributes (attributes that make a shape that specific shape)
3. Identify and explain the similarities and differences between two shapes.
4. Use concrete materials to create composite shapes from two or three-dimensional shapes (cubes, right rectangular prisms, right circular cones and right circular cylinders).
5. Use concrete materials to create a new shape from a composite shape.
6. Identify equal parts of a partitioned shape with concrete materials and describe the shares using the words halves, fourths, and quarters as well as the phrases half of, fourth of and quarter of.
7. Gather and collect data  to answer questions
8. Interpret data contained in picture graphs using a variety of categories with 1:1 intervals

Unit 5: Measurements
1. Measure length with nonstandard units (paper clips, toothpicks, unifix cubes, eraser length…) to understand that the length measurement of an object is the number of same-size length units that span it with no gaps or overlaps.
2. Order three objects by length. 
3. Compare the lengths of two objects indirectly by using a third object (concept of transitivity – a is shorter than b and b is shorter than c, so a is shorter than c).
4. Use tools to measure time to the hour and half hour intervals
5. Apply knowledge of fractional wholes and halves to telling time.
6. Compare the same time on analog and digital clocks to measure time to the hour and half hour.

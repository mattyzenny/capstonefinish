Description: In '3rd Grade Math', your child(ren) will develop an understanding of whole number multiplication and division, develop an understanding of fractions, beginning with unit fractions, recognize area as an attribute of a 2-dimensional shape, describe, anaylize, and compare properties or 2-dimensional shapes.

Unit 1: Foundations of Multiplication, Division, and Area
1. Interpret products of whole numbers, e.g., interpret 5 x 7 as the total number of objects in 5 groups of 7 objects each. Describe a context in which a total number of objects can be expressed as 5 x 7.
2. Identify arithmetic patterns (including patterns in the addition and multiplication table) and explain them using properties of operations.
3. Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide. If 6 x 4 is known, then 4 x 6 = 24 is also known. (commutative property of multiplication)
4 Interpret whole-number quotients of whole numbers. For example, interpret 56 / 8 as the number of objects in each share when 56 objects are partitioned equally into 8 shares, or as a number of shares when 56 objects are partitioned equally into equal shares of 8 objects each. Describe a context in which a number of shares or a number of groups can be expressed as 56/8
5. Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, and arrays. Use drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.
6. Recognize area as an attribute of plane figures and understand concepts of area and measurement. 
	a) A square with length 1 unit, called ‘a unit square", is said to  have "one square unit" of area, and can be used to measure area.
	b) A plane figure which can be covered without gaps or overlaps by n unit squares is said to have an area of n square units.
7. Measure areas by counting unit squares (square cm, square m, square in, square ft., and improvised units).
8. Relate area to the operations of multiplication and addition.
	a) Find the area of a rectangle with whole-number side lengths by tiling it, and show that the area is the same as would be found by multiplying the side lengths
9. Tell and write time to the nearest minute.

Unit 2: Addition, Subtraction, and Measurement
1. Add and subtract within 1000 using strategies and algorithms based on the following: place value, properties of operations and the relationship between addition and subtraction
2. Use place value understanding to round whole numbers to the nearest 10 or 100
3. Solve two-step word problems.  Represent these problems using equations with a letter standing for the unknown quantity. Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies including rounding.
4. Solve real world and mathematical problems involving perimeters of polygons, including finding the perimeter given the side lengths, finding an unknown side length.
5. Tell and write time to the nearest minute and measure time intervals in minutes.  Solve word problems involving addition and subtraction of time intervals in minutes, e.g., by representing the problem on a number line diagram.
6. Measure and estimate liquid volumes and masses of objects using standard units of grams (g), kilograms (kg), and liters (l). 
7. Add or subtract to solve one-step word problems involving masses or volumes that are given in the same units, e.g., by using drawings (such as a beaker with measurement scale) to represent the problem.

Unit 3: Equal Partitioning and Naming Fractions
1. Understand a fraction 1/b as the quantity formed by 1 part when a whole is partitioned into b equal parts; understand a fraction a/b as the quantity formed by a parts of size 1/b.
2. Partition shapes into parts with equal area.  Express the area of each part as a unit fraction of the whole.  For example, partition a shape into 4 parts with equal area, and describe the area of each part as ¼ of the area of the shape.
3. Understand a fraction as a number on the number line; represent fractions on a number line diagram.
4. Represent a fraction 1/b  on a number line diagram by defining the interval from 0 to 1 as the whole and partitioning it into b equal parts.  Recognize that each part has size 1/b and that the endpoint of the part based at 0 locates the number 1/b on the number line.
5. Represent a fraction a/b on a number line diagram by marking off a lengths 1/b from 0.  Recognize that the resulting interval has size a/b and that its endpoint locates the number a/b on the number line.

Unit 4: Multiplication and Division
1. Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measurement quantities.  Use drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem. 
2. Identify arithmetic patterns (including patterns in the addition and multiplication table) and explain them using properties of operations.
3. Interpret whole-number quotients of whole numbers.  For example, interpret 56 / 8 as the number of objects in each share when 56 objects are partitioned equally into 8 shares, or as a number of shares when 56 objects are partitioned equally into equal shares of 8 objects each.  Describe a context in which a number of shares or a number of groups can be expressed as 56/8
4. Solve two-step word problems using the four operations.  Represent these problems using equations with a letter for the unknown quantity.  Assess reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies including rounding.
5. Understand division as an unknown-factor problem.  For example, find 32/8 by finding the number that makes 32 when multiplied by 8.
6. Multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the relationship between multiplication and division (e.g. knowing that 8 x 5 = 40, one knows 40/8=5) or properties of operations.

Unit 5: Equivalence and Comparing Fractions
1. Explain equivalence of fractions in special cases, and compare fractions by reasoning about their size.
2. Understand two fractions as equivalent (equal) if they are the same size, or the same point on a number line.
3. Recognize and generate simple equivalent fractions, e.g., ½=2/4, 4/6=2/3).  Explain why the fractions are equivalent, e.g., by using a visual fraction model.
4. Express whole numbers as fractions, and recognize fractions that are equivalent to whole numbers.  Examples: Express 3 in the form 3 = 3/1; recognize that 6/1 = 6; locate 4/4 and 1 at the same point of a number line diagram.
5. Compare two fractions with the same numerator or the same denominator by reasoning about their size.  Recognize that comparisons are valid only when the two fractions refer to the same whole.  Record the results of comparisons with the symbols >,=, or <, and justify the conclusions, e.g., by using a visual fraction model.
6. Generate measurement data by measuring lengths using rulers marked with halves and fourths of an inch.
7. Show the data by making a line plot, where the horizontal scale is marked off inappropriate units- whole numbers, halves, or quarters.  (X’s or dots can be used to plot the data.)

Unit 6: Multiplication, Division, and Area
1. Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide.
2. If 3 x 5 x 2 can be found b 3 x 5 = 15, then 15 x 2= 30 , or by 5 x 2 = 10, then 3 x 10 = 30.  (associative property of multiplication)
3. Knowing that 8 x 5 = 40 and 8 x 2 = 16, one can find 8 x 7 as 8 x (5+2) = (8 x 5 ) = ( 8 x 2 ) – 40 + 16 = 56.  (distributive property)
4. Identify arithmetic patterns (including patterns in the addition and multiplication table) and explain them using properties of operations.
5. Determine the unknown whole number in a multiplication or division equation relating three whole numbers .   For example, determine the unknown number that makes the equation true in each of the equations 8 x ? = 48, 5 = __ / 3, 6 x 6 = ?.
6. Fluently multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the relationship between multiplication and division.  By the end of Grade 3, know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers.
7. Use place value understanding to round whole numbers to the nearest 10 or 100.
8. Multiply one-digit whole numbers by multiples of 10 in the range 10 – 90 (e.g., 9 x 80, 5 x 60) using strategies based on place value and properties of operations.
9. Solve two-step word problems using the four operations.  Represent these problems using equations with a letter standing for the unknown quantity.  Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies including rounding.

Unit 7: Geometry and Measurement
1. Understand that shapes in different categories (e.g., rhombuses, rectangles, and others) may share attributes (e.g., having four sides), and that the shared attributes can define a larger category (e.g., quadrilaterals). Recognize rhombuses, rectangles, and squares as examples of quadrilaterals, and draw examples of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories.
2. Solve real world and mathematical problems involving perimeters of polygons, including finding the perimeter given the side lengths, finding an unknown side length, and exhibiting rectangles with the same perimeter and different areas or with the same area and different perimeters.

Unit 8: Demonstrate Computational Fluency
1. Draw a scaled picture graph and a scaled bar graph to represent a data set with several categories. Solve one- and two-step “how many more” and “how many less” problems using information presented in scaled bar graphs. For example, draw a bar graph in which each square in the bar graph might represent 5 pets.
2. Measure and estimate liquid volumes and masses of objects using standard units of grams (g), kilograms (kg), and liters (l).    Add, subtract, multiply or divide to solve one-step word problems involving masses or volumes that are given in the same units, e.g., by using drawings (such as a beaker with measurement scale) to represent the problem.  (This unit extends students work in Unit 2 to include multiplication and division to solve problems involving measurement quantities).  Note: Students are NOT responsible for doing conversions.  However, the comparison between ml and l / g and kg may help students “reason” about volumes and masses.
3. Fluently add and subtract within 1000 using strategies and algorithms based on the following:  place value, properties of operations or the relationship between addition and subtraction.  Note:  A range of algorithms may be used.
4. Fluently multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the relationship between multiplication and division (e.g., knowing that 8 x 5 = 40, one knows 40 x 5 = 8) or properties of operations.  By the end of Grade 3, know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers.
5. Solve two-step problems involving the four operations.  Represent these problems using equations with a letter standing for the unknown quantity.  Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies including rounding.
